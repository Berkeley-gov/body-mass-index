# The Body Mass Index Calculator

Website link for project: https://body-mass-index-cal.netlify.app/

BMI API endpoints for Heroku: https://body-mass-index-cal.herokuapp.com/

## Introduction

This project demonstrates my ability to build a full-stack web application using the MERN technology stack.

The application uses client-server RESTful architecture principles. The Backend was written in NodeJS and it's referenced as the BMI API.
The BMI API allows for CRUD operations on user accounts and their BMIs.

## Project Aim
The goal of the project was to create a simple web application that allows users to create an account to track and calculate their body mass index.

## Summary 
The Body Mass Index Calculator application uses the BMI API, a modern RESTful API linked to an extensive database containing basic user account information. The API allows for CRUD operations on user accounts and their body mass index.

The application also uses bootstrap for a smooth and seamless user interface that is mobile responsive. 

Once on the website, users will be prompted to log in or create an account. Once they sign up for an account, users are then redirected to the home page where they can use the body mass index calculator and check if they are overweight. This is the main feature of the web application but it also allows users to update and delete information regarding their own accounts.

## Technologies
The following technologies were used to build this project:
* Bootstrap: v4.4.1
* HTML5
* JavaScript (React)
* NodeJS (Express, Web Pack, Mongoose)
* Database: MongooseDB
* Postman (API Testing)
* Mocha & Chai (Unit Testing)
* Deployment (Heroku and Netlify)
